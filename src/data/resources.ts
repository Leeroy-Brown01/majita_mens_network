      <h3>What is Gender-Based Violence?</h3>
      <p>Gender-based violence (GBV) is violence directed at an individual based on their biological sex, gender identity, or perceived adherence to socially defined norms of masculinity and femininity. It includes physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse, threats, coercion, and economic or educational deprivation.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of GBV:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical violence:</strong> Hitting, slapping, kicking, or any form of physical harm</li>
        <li><strong>Sexual violence:</strong> Rape, sexual assault, harassment, or coercion</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional/Psychological abuse:</strong> Threats, intimidation, isolation, humiliation</li>

        <li><strong>Digital violence:</strong> Cyberbullying, revenge porn, online harassment</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Everyone Has a Role to Play:</h3>
